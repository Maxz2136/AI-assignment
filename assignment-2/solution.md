# Explanation of the solution for the travelling salesman problem.

### Problem Statement
    
    To solve the travelling salesman problem with A* algorithm being used as the searching algorithm.
    
### Solution Explanation   

Since the search algorithm to be used should be A* algorithm,  so we should define our heuristic function which is a component of the A* algorithm. 

The heuristic function for the travelling salesman probem is the min-neighbour algorithm to find the sub-optimal path in TSP. 

It means ,given a node, and we have to find the heuristic cost of the node. we calculate it in the given way.
